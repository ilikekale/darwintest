Easy: Explain the meaning of these two DwC fields and their interaction: coordinatePrecision&coordinateUncertaintyInMeters

coordinatePrecision is A decimal representation of the precision of the coordinates given in the decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude.
decimalLatitude: The geographic latitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the 
geographic center of a Location. Positive values are north of the Equator, negative values are south of it. Legal values lie between
-90 and 90, inclusive.
decimalLongitude:The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the
geographic center of a Location. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values 
lie between -180 and 180, inclusive.
 
coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is The horizontal distance (in meters) from the given decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude describing the 
smallest circle containing the whole of the Location. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be estimated, or
is not applicable (because there are no coordinates). Zero is not a valid value for this term.
